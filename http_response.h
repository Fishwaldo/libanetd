/*! \brief Basic Memory Only HTTP Result Class
 *
 * This is a basic http_response class that is used to store the results of a HTTP Transfer in memory and pass the results back to the client
 * The results of a transfer are sent back to the caller as either a parameter in the http_request::setCallback function, or via a boost::promise via the http_request::Status variable.
 * Regardless of the success or failure of a HTTP Transfer, the http_response class is always sent back. Clients can check the http_request::getStatus() function to retrieve a status
 * value that is either a HTTP response code (eg, 200 for a successful transfer) or a negative number in case of internal library error
 *
 * Unless specifically mentioned as ThreadSafe in the member function descriptions, you should not call any of these functions from a client application till the transfer is complete.
 *
 * Classes that need to implement additional features should inherit this class as the base class.
